INSTALLATION

To install News::NNTPClient, perform the following steps.  You'll
likely need to have system administration (a.k.a root, super-user)
privilege to perform any of these steps:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

If that doesn't do it for you, you can try the following manual steps:

Copy NNTPClient.pm to perl5lib, where perl5lib is your local Perl 5
library directory, usually /usr/local/lib/perl5.  You'll likely have
to create the News directory, as the perl5 distribution doesn't
normally include it.  Be sure to give everyone read permission on the
file and read/execute permission on the directory.

    umask 022
    mkdir /usr/local/lib/perl5/News
    cp NNTPClient.pm /usr/local/lib/perl5/News

You could then run the following to create a man page:

    cd /usr/local/lib/perl5/News
    pod2man NNTPClient.pm > /usr/local/man/man1/NNTPClient.1
